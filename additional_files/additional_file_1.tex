\section*{Detailed methods}
\label{annexe-sv-gwas-detailed-methods}

\subsection*{Discovery of structural variation from Illumina data}
\label{sv-gwas-sv-discovery-illumina}

We used the Illumina whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the 389 selected \emph{G. max} accessions
for SV discovery using methods similar to those described by
\cite{lemay2022}.  Briefly, we used four different SV discovery programs or
pipelines: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item We used AsmVar \citep[version of 2015-04-16, ][]{liu2015} to call SVs
	from \emph{de novo} assemblies generated with SOAPdenovo2 v. 2.04
		\citep{luo2012} and aligned to the reference genome using LAST
		v. 1047 \citep{kielbasa2011}.
\item We ran Manta v. 1.6.0 \citep{chen2016} in randomly selected batches: 77 batches of
	5 samples and 1 batch of 4 samples. We used the candidate SVs
		identified from each of the batches for downstream analyses.
\item We used smoove v. 0.2.4 \citep{pedersen2019} to obtain a dataset of candidate SVs
	using the following sequence of commands:
	\texttt{smoove call}, \texttt{smoove merge}, \texttt{smoove
		genotype} and \texttt{smoove paste}.
		For three (3) of the 389 samples, we were unable
		to obtain candidate variants due to a reproducible
		error (segmentation fault) when running \texttt{smoove
		call}.
	\item We used SvABA v. 1.1.3 \citep{wala2018} to call SVs from each of the
	samples separately. We classified the SVs called as breakends by SvABA
		as either deletions, duplications or inversions, and converted
		them to explicit sequence using a custom R script. Variants
		called as indels by SvABA were used as is for downstream
		analyses.
\end{enumerate}

We filtered the SVs called by each tool to remove those meeting any of the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item smaller than 50 bp or larger than 500 kb in size
	\item located on unanchored scaffolds or organellar genomes
	\item classified as unresolved breakends (\texttt{SVTYPE=BND})
	\item containing at least one N in either the reference or alternate allele sequence
\end{itemize}

Next, we converted all filtered variants to a sequence-explicit format using
\texttt{bayesTyperTools convertAllele} \citep{sibbesen2018} and normalized them
using bcftools \texttt{norm} v. 1.10.2-105 \citep{li2009-samtools}.

A single VCF file was generated from the variants called using Illumina data by
running SVmerge \citep{wong2010} in two steps. In the first step, we merged
very similar variants among the ones called by the same tool using a
sliding window of 5 bp. Next, we used the output of the first merging steps
for all four tools and merged similar variants across the four datasets using
a sliding window of 15 bp. This approach was used because a
sliding window of 15 bp on the outputs of all tools without pre-merging
resulted in a computationally intractable number of pairwise comparisons.

\subsection*{Discovery of structural variation from Oxford Nanopore sequencing data}
\label{sv-gwas-sv-discovery-ont}

We used SVs discovered among 17 Canadian soybean cultivars sequenced using
Oxford Nano\-pore Technologies (ONT) by \cite{lemay2022} as an additional
source of candidate SVs. Although this set of cultivars does not overlap the
ones analyzed in this study, it is likely that many of the SVs occurring
in Canadian germplasm also occur in the germplasm used for this study given that modern soybean
cultivars are derived from a rather small set of progenitors. We merged the SVs detected in the
long-read (ONT) data with the ones discovered in the short-read (Illumina) data
using SVmerge and systematically favored SVs discovered by Illumina whenever
SVs from the two sets were to be merged.  Our rationale for favoring variants
discovered from the Illumina data was that whenever both technologies discover
the same variants, the breakpoints of SVs discovered from Illumina data are
likely to be more precise given the higher basecalling accuracy.

\subsection*{Discovery of structural variation from high-quality assemblies}
\label{sv-gwas-sv-discovery-assembly}

In addition to Illumina data from 389 accessions, we also used
high-quality genome assemblies of 29 \emph{G. max} or \emph{Glycine soja}
accessions to call SVs. We
retrieved 26 high-quality genomes assembled by \cite{liu2020-pangenome} as well
as the genome of the cultivar Zhonghuang 13 (ZH13) from the Genome Warehouse
repository (\url{https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gwh/}). Furthermore, we retrieved the genomes
of \emph{G. soja} accession W05 and \emph{G. max} cultivar Lee from SoyBase
\citep{grant2010}.

We used methods based on \cite{liu2020-pangenome} to call SVs from the
genome assemblies.  First, we used the nucmer program of the MUMmer suite of
tools v. 4.0.0rc1 \citep{marcais2018} with option \texttt{-c 1000} to align
each of the assemblies to the Williams82 assembly. Next, we used the
delta-filter program of the MUMmer suite to keep only one-to-one alignments
between any genome and the Williams82 reference using the \texttt{-1} option.
The filtered alignments were used to call SVs with a version of the svmu
program \citep{chakraborty2019} that we forked from the original repository
(\url{https://github.com/malemay/svmu}) in order to improve execution time and
memory usage.

We used a set of tools that we assembled in an R package called svmutools
\url{https://github.com/malemay/svmutools} to convert the svmu output to VCF
format. We limited ourselves to processing deletions and insertions because of
the complexity of resolving other types of variants from whole-genome
assemblies.  Copy number variants and inversions called by svmu were therefore
excluded from downstream analyses. The
resulting set of variants was filtered to remove those smaller than 50 bp or larger than 500
kb and those with any N in either the reference or alternate allele sequence.
Finally, we normalized the VCF files using \texttt{bcftools norm} and merged
them using SVmerge to obtain a single file with variants discovered through
comparison of high-quality genome assemblies.

\subsection*{Genotyping structural variation using Paragraph}
\label{sv-gwas-sv-genotyping-paragraph}

We used Paragraph v. 2.4a \citep{chen2019}
to generate a set of SV genotypes from the Illumina data of the 389 accessions.
The set of SVs used as input for Paragraph was generated using SVmerge by
merging variants discovered from the Illumina and ONT data with
those discovered from the high-quality assemblies and svmu.
Variants in this candidate set were prepared for input to Paragraph by first removing
those closer than 150 bp (the maximum read length in our dataset) to any
chromosome end and then padding the variant representation using a script written by
\cite{hickey2020}. 

We ran Paragraph individually on each sample as recommended by the authors.  We
computed the average sequencing depth for each sample from the output of the
\texttt{samtools coverage} command and used 20 times that value for the
\texttt{-M} parameter of Paragraph.  We ran Paragraph using the
\texttt{multigrmpy} command and merged the resulting VCF files using
\texttt{bcftools merge} in order to get a  single genotype file for the whole
population. The resulting genotype calls were filtered as described in the main
text.

\subsection*{Comparison of WGS and SoySNP50K genotypes}
\label{annexe-sv-gwas-soysnp50k}
When we first analyzed the results from the GWAS analysis on all 389 samples,
we found discrepancies between the haplotypes at some loci and the expected
phenotype that should correspond to that haplotype for simple traits such as
flower color and seed coat color. Upon further analysis, we found that a
mismatch between the sequencing data and the identity of the accession was the
most probable cause of these discrepancies. In order to identify the samples
for which this could be the case, we compared the genotypes of SNPs obtained
from the SoySNP50K array \cite{song2013} to those predicted from the Illumina WGS
data. We did this for the 385 samples that had a match in the GRIN database. Briefly, we
retrieved SoySNP50K genotype calls from SoyBase \citep{grant2010} and extracted
all SNPs with a MAF $\geq$ 0.1 in our population. We then translated the positions
of these SNPs from assembly version 2 to assembly version 4 of Williams by
finding exact matches of 41-bp sequences surrounding the SNP positions. The
32,852 SNPs for which unambiguous positions could be found on genome assembly
version 4 were genotyped from the mapped WGS reads using \texttt{bcftools
mpileup} and \texttt{bcftools call}. We then used \texttt{bcftools gtcheck} to
compute the concordance between the WGS genotype calls and the
SoySNP50K genotype dataset. We identified 24 samples
with < 90\% concordance between the two genotype datasets and removed them from
the dataset. We also excluded an additional sample for which concordance was over 90\%
but poor raw sequencing data quality (\%GC content) suggested contamination.
The concordance between WGS data and SoySNP50K genotypes is included in
Additional file 3 and shown in Figure \ref{concordance-histogram}.

\subsection*{Analysis of extremely low \textit{p}-values}
\label{annexe-sv-gwas-pvalues}

For one trait (flower color), the significance of some \emph{k}-mers was so
high that their \emph{p}-values were numerically equal to 0. In order to
compute $-\log_{10} (p)$ for visualization in Manhattan plots in these cases,
we set the \emph{p}-value to the smallest numerical value that could be
represented using R on our machine (2.225074e-308). In this particular case,
the values represented on the Manhattan plots represent an upper bound on the
\emph{p}-value and not an exact value.

% Detailed results that are not meant to fit the main paper
\section*{Supplemental results}
\label{annexe-sv-gwas-detailed-results}

This section describes results at additional loci that were not discussed in
the main text. A summary of the signals found at all loci using all three GWAS
methods is presented in Table \ref{signals_table}.

\subsection*{Flower color -- \textit{L1} locus}
\label{annexe-sv-gwas-flower-color-l1}

In addition to the \textit{W1} locus, \cite{bandillo2017} reported a signal for
flower color near the \textit{L1} locus.  None of the GWAS approaches that we
tested found a signal for flower color near this locus (Figure
\ref{flower_color_manhattan}). This result is unsurprising as W1 is the major
contributor to flower color in soybean, whereas the \textit{L1} locus
(typically associated with pod color) was detected with a much less significant
\textit{p}-value (see Table \ref{signals_table}) and only conjectured as
associated with flower color by \cite{bandillo2017}.

\subsection*{Pubescence color -- locus on chromosome Gm16}
\label{annexe-sv-gwas-pubescence-color-gm16}

In addition to the \textit{T} locus, the first GWAS analysis conducted on pubescence color
revealed a second locus on chromosome Gm16
(Figure \ref{pubescence_color_all_manhattan}). Upon closer analysis, this locus
appeared to be in strong LD with \emph{k}-mers mapping to chromosome Gm01 and
most importantly in moderate LD with the \emph{T} locus (Figure
\ref{pubescence_color_all_ld}), which suggests that this does not represent an
independent locus controlling pubescence color. This interpretation is also
supported by the fact that the signal at that locus only spans about 10 kb on
chromosome Gm16.

\subsection*{Seed coat color -- loci \textit{T}, \textit{O} and \textit{R}}
\label{annexe-sv-gwas-seed-coat-color-t-o}

In addition to the \textit{I} and \textit{G} loci, the \textit{k}-mer-based
GWAS analysis of five different seed coat color phenotypes (first GWAS in Table
\ref{SEED.COAT.COLOR_gwas_table}) detected weak signals overlapping the
\emph{T} and \emph{O} loci (Figure \ref{seed_coat_color_all_manhattan}c).
However, we interpreted those results as chance associations given the low
\textit{p}-value associated with the \emph{T} locus and the proximity of the
\emph{O} locus to the \emph{I} locus. None of the three GWAS approaches detected
a signal overlapping the \textit{R} locus.

\subsection*{Stem termination type -- loci \textit{Dt2} and \textit{E3}}
\label{sv-gwas-stem-termination}

We performed a GWAS analysis comparing only semi-determinate and indeterminate
stem termination phenotypes in an attempt to detect signals at the \emph{Dt2}
locus (Table \ref{STEM.TERMINATION.TYPE_gwas_table}).  However, this was
unsuccessful using all three GWAS approaches (Figure
\ref{stem_termination_sn_manhattan}). Similarly, we failed to detect signals at
the \textit{E3} locus, which is more commonly associated with maturity but was
mentioned as associated with stem termination type by \cite{bandillo2017}.

% Hilum color - T locus
\subsection*{Hilum color -- \textit{T} locus}
\label{annexe-sv-gwas-results-hilum-color-t}

The \textit{T} locus discussed in the main text for pubescence color is also a determining
locus for hilum color. We detected signals overlapping the corresponding gene
using all approaches (Figures \ref{hilum_color_all_manhattan},
\ref{hilum_color_all_T_signal}). The regions defined by the top 5\% (SVs)
and top 1\% (SNPs and \textit{k}-mers) variants included
the Glyma.06g202300 gene associated with this locus. Similarly to what we
observed for the analysis of the \textit{T} locus based on pubescence color, we
did identify the documented causal variant at this locus using the Platypus and
\textit{k}-mer analyses, although these variants were not the most
significantly associated overall (Figures \ref{hilum_color_all_T_gene},
\ref{hilum_color_all_T_kmers}).

% Hilum color - I locus
\subsection*{Hilum color -- \textit{I} locus}
\label{annexe-sv-gwas-results-hilum-color-i}

Similarly, the \textit{I} locus discussed in the main text for its effect on seed coat
color also controls hilum color and we detected signals overlapping the
associated inverted duplication using all approaches (Figures
\ref{hilum_color_all_manhattan}, \ref{hilum_color_all_I_signal}). However,
as was the case for the effect of \textit{I} on seed coat color, we were
not able to link any of the variants identified to the causal variation given
its highly complex nature.

\subsection*{Hilum color -- loci \textit{W1} and \textit{O}}
\label{sv-gwas-hilum-color}

None of the three GWAS analyses that we conducted on hilum color found signals
at the \emph{W1} and \emph{O} loci studied by \cite{bandillo2017} (Figures
\ref{hilum_color_all_manhattan}, \ref{hilum_color_blackbrown_manhattan},
\ref{hilum_color_rbr_manhattan}).

\subsection*{Pubescence density -- loci \textit{Pd1} and \textit{P1}}
\label{sv-gwas-pubescence-density}

Our GWAS analysis on pubescence density did not detect any signals at the
\emph{Pd1} and \emph{P1} (Figure \ref{pubescence_density_manhattan}). Our
failure to detect these loci is likely due to our small population size
compared to \cite{bandillo2017} and to the smaller contribution of those loci
to pubescence density in our population.

\subsection*{Seed coat luster -- loci \textit{Hps}, \textit{B?} and \textit{I}}
\label{sv-gwas-seed-coat-luster}

We performed three different GWAS analyses on seed coat luster (Table
\ref{SEED.COAT.LUSTER_gwas_table}). Since all three analyses yielded similar results
(Figure \ref{seed_coat_luster_all_manhattan},
\ref{seed_coat_luster_nointermediate_manhattan} and
\ref{seed_coat_luster_dullshiny_manhattan}), we chose to focus on the
GWAS contrasting the dull and shiny phenotypes as it yielded the most
significant signals. In addition, it also provided results that were most consistent with the
analysis previously done by \cite{bandillo2017}.

The analysis detected signals at the \emph{B} locus as the sole classical locus
using all three methods (see main text and Figure
\ref{seed_coat_luster_dullshiny_manhattan}).  All methods also detected signals
overlapping the \emph{Hps} locus as defined by \cite{bandillo2017}, however
results shown by \cite{gijzen2003} and our results suggest that \emph{Hps} and
\emph{B} are the same locus. 

Apparent signals on chromosomes Gm20 and Gm09 (which may correspond to the B?
locus reported by \cite{bandillo2017}) were also detected, but analysis of the
LD patterns between \emph{k}-mers suggested that these signals are most likely
in LD with the \emph{B} locus (Figure \ref{seed_coat_luster_dullshiny_ld}).

\cite{bandillo2017} mentioned the \textit{I} locus as possibly associated
with seed coat luster, however we did not find evidence for such an association
in our dataset.

\subsection*{Pubescence form -- additional loci}
\label{sv-gwas-pubesence-form}

The first GWAS analysis on pubescence form found signals on chromosomes Gm04
and Gm15 with SNPs and \emph{k}-mers (Figure
\ref{pubescence_form_all_manhattan}). However, upon further analysis of LD
patterns, they appeared to be linked to the \emph{Pa1} locus (Figure
\ref{pubescence_form_all_ld}).


\subsection*{Maturity group}
\label{annexe-sv-gwas-maturity}

We did not detect any signals associated with maturity using our dataset
(Figure \ref{maturity_group_manhattan}). The use of maturity group as a proxy
for time to maturity instead of the number of days, combined with the limited
phenotypic variation of this trait in this collection of accessions (Table
\ref{MATURITY.GROUP_gwas_table}), likely explains our failure to detect
any signals.

\subsection*{Seed oil and protein content}
\label{sv-gwas-seed-oil-protein-content}

We conducted a GWAS analysis on seed oil content using data obtained from the
GRIN database. While several seed oil content quantitative trait loci (QTL)
have been reported due to high interest in this trait for soybean breeding
\citep{chaudhary2015}, we focused on two major QTL on chromosomes Gm15 and Gm20.
These loci have often been reported in \emph{G. max} and were notably observed by
\cite{bandillo2015} on a collection of USDA lines using SoySNP50K chip
genotypes and GRIN phenotypic data. We identified a signal located on
chromosome Gm15 using the \emph{k}-mer approach only (Figure
\ref{oil_manhattan}). Although this signal did not overlap with the coordinates
found by \cite{bandillo2017}, it was located only 2 kb away from it and 30 kb
away from Glyma.15g049200, the sugar transporter gene identified by
\cite{zhang2020} as associated with that locus. Therefore, the significantly
associated \emph{k}-mers were not linked to the causal variation at that locus.

Similarly to seed oil content, we conducted a GWAS on seed protein content
using data obtained from the GRIN database. As is generally the case in
soybean given the negative correlation between seed oil and protein content,
the two major QTL considered above and reported by \cite{bandillo2015} for seed
oil content are also major QTL for seed protein content. However, none of the
approaches detected a signal at this locus (Figure \ref{protein_manhattan}).

Our failure to detect signals overlapping the known genes at these two loci for
oil and protein is probably due to the fact that the oil and protein content
data that we used for GWAS were not obtained from orthogonal trials, which was
a clear limitation to this GWAS given our relatively small sample size.
